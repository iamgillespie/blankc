# It's a Doppel! 

This one has a Kansas-grown walnut body and a zebrawood top. It's all chambered, of course. I went wild with the contours on the back and really love the look and feel. It's got two Iron Gear Surf Rider pickups in it-- basically very hot jazzmaster pickups-- and it's got that great "plunk" sound that jazzmasters make. It's got CTS pots and a traditional volume/tone setup. Fender bridge.The neck is mahogany with an ebony fretboard, with a sort of blended LP-ish headstock-- not a scarf joint, though. Bone nut, 9.5" radius neck. This one is very versatile and a looker!
