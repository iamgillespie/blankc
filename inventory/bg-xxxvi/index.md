Like a strat, but *skinnier *with a more dense wood. Monkeypod solidbody with lots of cool details in the grain. Roasted maple neck with a ribboned sapele fretboard and BG peacock symbol. SSS configuration with Fender pickups. Gotoh tremolo bridge and tuners. Neck-on switch for bonus tele-tones. Bright but warm!
